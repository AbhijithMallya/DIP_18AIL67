# Programs List: PART A

This repository contains a collection of programs written in Python for digital image processing.

## 1. Split and Display Image into 4 Quadrants

### Description

This program reads a digital image and splits it into four quadrants, displaying them separately. The four quadrants will be: up, down, right and left.

### Implementation

[To be added]

## 2. Image Rotation, Scaling and Translation

### Description

This program demonstrates the rotation, scaling, and translation of an image.

### Implementation

[To be added]

## 3. Erosion and Dilation on Images

### Description

This program reads an image and applies erosion to it, then subtracts the result from the original. It also demonstrates the difference in the edge image if dilation is used instead of erosion.

### Implementation

[To be added]

## 4. Extracting Low-Level Features from Images

### Description

This program reads an image and extracts and displays low-level features such as edges and textures using filtering techniques.

### Implementation
